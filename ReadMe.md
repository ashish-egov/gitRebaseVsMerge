Let's say we have two branches,  `master`  and  `feature`, and two files:  `file1.py`  and  `file2.py`. The  `file1.py`  contains some code that calculates the sum of two numbers, and the  `file2.py`  contains some code that prints a message to the console.

Here is the initial content of the  `file1.py`  and  `file2.py`  in the  `master`  branch:


```
# file1.py
def sum(a, b):
    return a + b

# file2.py
print("Hello, World!")

```

And here is the initial content of the  `file1.py`  and  `file2.py`  in the  `feature`  branch:


```
# file1.py
def sum(a, b):
    return a + b + 1

# file2.py
print("Goodbye, World!")

```

Now, let's say we want to incorporate the changes in the  `feature`  branch into the  `master`  branch.

Here is an example of merging the  `feature`  branch into the  `master`  branch:


```
# switch to the master branch
git checkout master

# merge the feature branch into the master branch
git merge feature

```

When we run the  `git merge feature`  command, Git creates a new commit that combines the changes from both branches. The resulting content of the  `file1.py`  and  `file2.py`  in the  `master`  branch after the merge will be:



```
# file1.py
def sum(a, b):
    return a + b + 1

# file2.py
print("Goodbye, World!")
print("Hello, World!")

```

Here is an example of rebasing the  `feature`  branch on top of the  `master`  branch:


```
# switch to the feature branch
git checkout feature

# rebase the feature branch on top of the master branch
git rebase master

```

When we run the  `git rebase master`  command, Git moves the entire  `feature`  branch to the latest commit of the  `master`  branch and applies the changes from the  `feature`  branch on top of it. The resulting content of the  `file1.py`  and  `file2.py`  in the  `feature`  branch after the rebase will be:

```
# file1.py
def sum(a, b):
    return a + b + 1

# file2.py
print("Goodbye, World!")

```

In summary, merging creates a new commit that combines changes from both branches, while rebasing moves the entire branch to a new base commit and applies the changes on top of it. The resulting content of the files after the merge or rebase will depend on the specific changes made in each branch.
